# GDRest
___
GDRest is a Geometry Dash REST API written with Python ASGI libraries.  
It doesn't include likes and other small details (for that use the
[GDBrowser API](https://gdbrowser.com/api) instead), but allows you to
listen to Newgrounds and level songs (custom ones) directly from the API.

## Get started
### Installing
Follow the instructions on the [GitHub README](https://github.com/Silverflower67/GDRest)
### Running
For running the server, run in a command line:  
`python -m gdrest`  
Then you can test the API with some REST client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com)
or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest). There is a predefined config file
for the last one (`Insomnia.json`)
